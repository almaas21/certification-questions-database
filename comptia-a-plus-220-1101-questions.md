### Question 540
**Question Type:** Multiple Select (Choose two)  
**Topic:** Mobile Device Security

A company issued smartphones to users who work from home. The devices are enrolled and configured within the company's MDM, and hardening profiles were deployed to each device for greater security. Which of the following services best enhances security for remote users accessing company resources? (Choose two.)

**Answer Choices:**
A. Two-factor authentication
B. Managed corporate applications
C. Cloud data synchronization
D. Automated device setup
E. GPS location tracking
F. PIN code enforcement

**Correct Answer:** A, F

**Detailed Explanation:**
- **Two-factor authentication (2FA)** adds an extra layer of security by requiring users to provide two forms of identification (e.g., a password and a code from an app or SMS/mobile app token) before granting access. This significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access, even if one credential is compromised.

- **PIN code enforcement** adds an additional layer of security by ensuring that devices are protected by a unique PIN. This makes physical access to the device more challenging for unauthorized users and prevents unauthorized access to the device and its contents if it's lost or stolen.

**Community Voting Statistics:**
- AF combination: 75%
- AB combination: 25%
- B: 20%

**Community Comments:**
- "Two-factor authentication (2FA) significantly enhances security by requiring two forms of verification before granting access" (3 upvotes)

A. Security groups
B. Audit logs
C. Time-of-day access
D. Print server

**Correct Answer:** A

**Detailed Explanation:**
Security groups allow you to control access to resources by assigning permissions to specific groups of users. This way, only members of the human resources department will have access to the materials.

- **Why Not B:** Audit logs monitor activity but do not restrict access.
- **Why Not C:** Time-of-day access limits when users can access resources but doesn't specify user permissions.
- **Why Not D:** A print server manages print jobs but does not control file access.

**Community Voting Statistics:**
- A: 100% (unanimous)
- C: 25%
- B: 20%

**Community Comments:**
- "Security groups allow you to control access to resources by assigning permissions to specific groups of users" (6 upvotes)

### Question 68
**Question Type:** Single Choice  
**Topic:** Email Security

Recently, an organization received a number of spam emails that passed through the spam gateway. These emails contained generally the same information, but the sending domains were different. Which of the following solutions would BEST help mitigate the issue?

**Answer Choices:**
A. Updating the keyword filtering
B. Editing the sender policy framework
C. Contacting the gateway vendor
D. Verifying DMARC is enabled

**Correct Answer:** A

**Detailed Explanation:**
Updating the keyword filtering is the best solution because the emails have mostly the same content but different sending domains. Keyword filtering helps detect spam by refining keywords common in spam messages, making it efficient for targeting email content when the spam is coming from various sending domains but has similar content.

- **Why Not B:** SPF (Sender Policy Framework) is for verifying the sender's domain, not filtering content
- **Why Not C:** Contacting the vendor is troubleshooting, not a solution
- **Why Not D:** DMARC is for outgoing emails to prevent spoofing, not for filtering incoming spam from external domains

**Community Comments:**
- "Updating keyword filtering helps detect spam by refining keywords common in spam messages, especially since emails have similar content but different domains" (community consensus)
- "DMARC is for outgoing mail, not inbound. Therefore, A is more appropriate for incoming spam"
