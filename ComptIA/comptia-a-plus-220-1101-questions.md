- D. Check the vendor's website for guidance.

**Correct Answer:** B - Identify any changes the user has made

**Explanation:**  
According to CompTIA troubleshooting methodology, the first step when troubleshooting a recent issue is to identify any changes that have been made to the system. Since the application worked yesterday but not today, something must have changed. This approach helps narrow down the root cause quickly.

## Question 3 - Topic 1
**Question Type:** Multiple Choice

**Question Text:**  
A user with a custom hosts file is having difficulty connecting to a locally hosted site on a small office network. The technician cannot ping the server hostname from the user's computer. Which of the following should the technician ensure on the server?

**Answer Choices:**  
- A. The server is configured with a static IP address.
- B. The server does not have an APIPA.
- C. The appropriate services are enabled on the server.
- D. The server's secondary NIC is functioning.

**Correct Answer:** A - The server is configured with a static IP address.

**Explanation:**  
A static IP address ensures a consistent and predictable address for the server. If the server's IP address changes dynamically (for example, through DHCP), the custom hosts file on the user's computer may not be able to resolve the correct hostname to the changing IP address. This is the most common cause of hostname resolution issues with custom hosts files.

## Question 8 - Topic 1
**Question Type:** Multiple Choice

- B. Punchdown tool
- C. Toner probe
- D. Crimper

**Correct Answer:** C - Toner probe

**Explanation:**  
A toner probe (also called a toner and probe) is used to identify specific cables in a bundle. It generates a tone on one end of a cable that can be detected with a probe on the other end, making it easy to identify the correct port when patch panels and ports are unlabeled.
