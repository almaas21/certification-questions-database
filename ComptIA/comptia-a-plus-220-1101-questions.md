### Question 540
**Question Type:** Multiple Select (Choose two)  
**Topic:** Mobile Device Security

A company issued smartphones to users who work from home. The devices are enrolled and configured within the company's MDM, and hardening profiles were deployed to each device for greater security. Which of the following services best enhances security for remote users accessing company resources? (Choose two.)

**Answer Choices:**
A. Two-factor authentication
B. Managed corporate applications
C. Cloud data synchronization
D. Automated device setup
E. GPS location tracking
F. PIN code enforcement

**Correct Answer:** A, F

**Detailed Explanation:**
- **Two-factor authentication (2FA)** adds an extra layer of security by requiring users to provide two forms of identification (e.g., a password and a code from an app or SMS/mobile app token) before granting access. This significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access, even if one credential is compromised.

- **PIN code enforcement** adds an additional layer of security by ensuring that devices are protected by a unique PIN. This makes physical access to the device more challenging for unauthorized users and prevents unauthorized access to the device and its contents if it's lost or stolen.

### Question 32
**Question Type:** Multiple Select (Choose two)  
**Topic:** POST Beep Codes and Boot Sequence

A user reboots a machine. On rebooting, the user hears one beep, and then an error message is displayed. Which of the following are MOST likely causing this issue? (Choose two.)

**Answer Choices:**
A. RAM module
B. Graphics card
C. CPU
D. Boot order
E. USB flash drive
F. Power supply

**Correct Answers:** D, E

**Detailed Explanation:**
The prevalent view is that a single beep during reboot typically indicates a successful Power-On Self-Test (POST), meaning core hardware components (RAM, CPU, Graphics card) have passed initial checks and are functioning. The subsequent error message is highly likely to be related to the system's inability to locate or load an operating system. This commonly arises from an incorrect boot order (D), where BIOS/UEFI settings prioritize a non-bootable device, or an attached USB flash drive (E) that does not contain a valid operating system.

**Community Voting Statistics:**
- DE combination: 61%
- AC combination: 17%
- Other combinations: 22%

**Community Comments:**
- "One beep means successful POST, error message indicates boot sequence failure" (community consensus)
