### Question 540
**Question Type:** Multiple Select (Choose two)  
**Topic:** Mobile Device Security

A company issued smartphones to users who work from home. The devices are enrolled and configured within the company's MDM, and hardening profiles were deployed to each device for greater security. Which of the following services best enhances security for remote users accessing company resources? (Choose two.)

**Answer Choices:**
A. Two-factor authentication
B. Managed corporate applications
C. Cloud data synchronization
D. Automated device setup
E. GPS location tracking
F. PIN code enforcement

**Correct Answers:** A, F

**Detailed Explanation:**
For enhanced security of remote users accessing company resources, two-factor authentication and PIN code enforcement provide critical additional layers of security beyond MDM hardening profiles. Two-factor authentication ensures that even if credentials are compromised, an additional verification method is required. PIN code enforcement ensures basic device access security.

- **Why Not B:** Managed corporate applications are useful but don't directly enhance access security.
- **Why Not C:** Cloud data synchronization is a convenience feature, not a security enhancement.
- **Why Not D:** Automated device setup is for initial provisioning, not ongoing security.
- **Why Not E:** GPS tracking is for device recovery, not access security.

- A: 89%
- F: 87%
- B: 45%
- C: 23%
- D: 12%
- E: 8%

**Community Comments:**
- "Two-factor authentication and PIN enforcement are the most critical for remote access security" (consensus)
- "These provide defense in depth beyond just device hardening" (community agreement)
