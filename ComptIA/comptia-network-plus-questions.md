# CompTIA Network+ (N10-008/N10-009) Questions

### Question 56
**Question Type:** Single Choice  
**Topic:** Network Performance and Duplex Settings

A network engineer is investigating reports of poor network performance. Upon reviewing a device configuration, the engineer finds that duplex settings are mismatched on both ends. Which of the following would be the MOST likely result of this finding?

**Answer Choices:**
A. Increased CRC errors
B. Increased giants and runts
C. Increased switching loops
D. Increased device temperature

**Correct Answer:** A

**Detailed Explanation:**
A duplex mismatch will usually generate excessive CRC errors. The different duplex settings on both ends of a connection can cause a mismatch in the flow control (sending data at different speed), leading data collisions. These collisions can result in corrupted data and increase the number of CRC errors.

According to the official CompTIA Network+ 008 Student Guide (Lesson 12, page 291): "A runt is a frame that is smaller than the minimum size (64 bytes for Ethernet). A runt frame is usually caused by a collision. In a switched environment, collisions should only be experienced on an interface connected to a legacy hub device and there is a duplex mismatch in the interface configuration."

**Community Voting Statistics:**
- A: 93%
- Other: 7%

**Community Comments:**
- "A mismatch will usually generate excessive CRC errors. Mismatch = ERROR" (12 upvotes)
- "The different duplex settings on both ends can cause a mismatch in the flow control, leading to data collisions" (7 upvotes)
