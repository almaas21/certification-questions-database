### Question 470
**Question Type:** Single Choice  
**Topic:** IoT Security

Which of the following is most likely a security concern when installing and using low-cost IoT devices in infrastructure environments?

**Answer Choices:**
A. Country of origin
B. Device responsiveness
C. Ease of deployment
D. Storage of data

**Correct Answer:** D

**Detailed Explanation:**
Low-cost IoT devices often lack robust security features, making them vulnerable to data breaches, unauthorized access, or misuse of sensitive information. Poorly secured data storage can lead to significant risks in infrastructure environments.

According to the CompTIA guide, the sheer volume of data generated by IoT devices makes securing and protecting sensitive information difficult. This increases the risk of data breaches and cyberattacks, potentially leading to the theft of personal and sensitive data.

Such devices typically lack encryption or secure data storage, do not follow robust security development lifecycles, and store sensitive information locally or in the cloud without proper protections. This is a critical concern, especially when devices collect or transmit sensitive information like sensor data, video feeds, or network/user activity logs.

- **Why Not A:** While country of origin can be a concern, it's not the primary security issue with IoT devices
- **Why Not B:** Device responsiveness is primarily a performance concern, not a direct security concern
- **Why Not C:** Ease of deployment is an operational or convenience concern, not a direct security concern

**Community Voting Statistics:**
- D: 60%
- A: 40%
- B: 20%

**Community Comments:**

### Question 575
**Question Type:** Single Choice  
**Topic:** Mobile Device Policy

A company is changing its mobile device policy. The company has the following requirements:
• Company-owned devices
• Ability to harden the devices
• Reduced security risk
• Compatibility with company resources

Which of the following would best meet these requirements?

**Answer Choices:**
A. BYOD
B. CYOD
C. COPE
D. COBO

**Correct Answer:** D

**Detailed Explanation:**
COBO (Company-Owned, Business-Only) is the most frequently selected and highly supported answer by the community. COBO provides the highest level of security and control because the devices are entirely owned by the company and restricted exclusively to business purposes. This allows full enforcement of security policies, device hardening, application control, and updates, minimizing risks associated with personal use.

It ensures maximum security and control, making it the best fit when security is a primary concern and user flexibility (personal use) is not a requirement.

**Why other options are less suitable:**
- **A. BYOD (Bring Your Own Device):** Employees use personal devices, making it difficult for the company to enforce strong security policies, harden devices, or ensure full compatibility.
- **B. CYOD (Choose Your Own Device):** Employees select from a list of approved devices, but they are often still used for personal tasks, which can increase risk and complicate security enforcement.
- **C. COPE (Corporate-Owned, Personally Enabled):** While some argue for COPE, it allows limited personal use, which introduces a slightly higher security risk compared to COBO.

**Community Comments:**
- "COBO (Corporate Owned Business Only) as most secure, and that A, B, C are less secure" (community consensus)
- "COBO provides the highest level of security and control, allowing full enforcement of security policies"
